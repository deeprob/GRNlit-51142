    "1. Built a Gene Regulatory Network that captures the interactions between transcription factors and target genes of Cyanothece 51142 obtained from 7 literature sources specified below. \n",
    "2. The network has been updated to include the cyclicity, function, expression period and participation in a metabolic pathway of transcription factors or target genes as available in literature. \n",
    "3. All the interactions are predicted by using microarray experiment data. I will include a detailed review of the algorithms used to predict the interactions in my next report as suggested by you in our previous meeting. \n",
    "4. The network is sparse due to limited literature on Cyanothece 51142. "

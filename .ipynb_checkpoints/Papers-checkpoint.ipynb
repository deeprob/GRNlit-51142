    "\"These experiments aim to reveal the dynamic features that occur during the metabolism of the unicellular, nitrogen fixing cyanobacterium Cyanothece sp. when exposed to diverse circadian forcing patterns (LD 16:8, LD 12:12, LD 8:16, LD  6:6).  The  chlorophyll  concentration  grew  rapidly  from  subjective  morning when  first  illuminated  to  around  noon,  then  remained  stable  from  later  in  the afternoon and throughout the night. The optical density measured at 735 nm was stable during the morning chlorophyll accumulation, then increased in the early afternoon toward a peak, followed at dusk by a rapid decline toward the late night steady state. The authors propose that these dynamics largely reflect accumulation and subsequent consumption of glycogen granules. This hypothesis is consistent with the sharp peak of respiration that coincides with the putative hydrocarbon catabolism.  In  the  long-day  regimen  (LD  16:8),  these  events  may  mark  the transition  from  the  aerobic  photosynthetic  metabolism  to  microaerobic  nitrogen metabolism that occurs at dusk, and thus cannot be triggered by the darkness that comes later. Rather, control is likely to originate in the circadian clock signaling an approaching night. To explore the dynamics of the link between respiration and circadian  oscillations,  the  authors  extrapolated  an  earlier  model  of  the  KaiABC oscillator  from Synechococcus  elongatus  to Cyanothece  sp.  The  measured  peak  of respiratory activity at dusk correlated strongly in its timing and time width with the  modeled  peak  in  accumulation  of  the  KaiB4  complex,  which  marks  the  late afternoon phase of the circadian clock. The authors propose a hypothesis that high levels of KaiB4 (or of its Cyanothece sp. analog) trigger the glycogen catabolism that is reflected in the experiments in the respiratory peak. The degree of the correlation between  the  modeled  KaiB4  dynamics  and  the  dynamics  of  experimentally measured peaks of respiratory activity was further tested during the half-circadian regimen  (LD  6:6).  The  model  predicted  an  irregular  pattern  of  the  KaiABC oscillator, quite unlike mechanical or electrical clock pacemakers that are strongly damped when driven at double their endogenous frequency. This highly unusual dynamic pattern was confirmed experimentally, supporting strongly the validity of the circadian model and of the proposed direct link to respiration.\"\n",

In addition, we used a context‐likelihood of relatedness (CLR) analysis with these data and those from 2 d L:D and L:D plus continuous light experiments to better differentiate between diurnal and circadian‐regulated genes. Cyanothece sp. acclimated in several ways to growth under short L:D conditions. Nitrogen was fixed in every second dark period and only once in each 24 h period. Nitrogen fixation was strongly correlated to the energy status of the cells and glycogen breakdown, and high respiration rates were necessary to provide appropriate energy and anoxic conditions for this process. We conclude that glycogen breakdown is a key regulatory step within these complex processes. Our results demonstrated that the main metabolic genes involved in photosynthesis, respiration, nitrogen fixation, and central carbohydrate metabolism have strong (or total) circadian‐regulated components. The short L:D cycles enable us to identify transcriptional differences among the family of psbA genes, as well as the differing patterns of the hup genes, which follow the same pattern as nitrogenase genes, relative to the hox genes, which displayed a diurnal, dark‐dependent gene expression.\"\n",

    "\"This review will discuss the strategies devised by the unicellular, diazotrophic cyanobacterium, Cyanothece sp. ATCC 51142, to permit N2 fixation and photosynthesis to coexist in the same cell. This strain, like a number of other unicellular and filamentous (non-heterocystous) cyanobacteria, has developed a type of temporal regulation in which N2 fixation and photosynthesis occur at different times throughout a diurnal cycle. For nitrogenase, everyday dawns anew. The nifHDK operon is tightly regulated, such that transcription and translation occur within the first four hours of the dark period; nitrogenase is then proteolytically degraded. Photosynthesis also varies throughout the day reaching a minimum at the peak of nitrogenase activity and a maximum by late afternoon. This review will mainly concentrate on the various changes that occur in the photosynthetic apparatus as the cell modulates O2 evolution. The results indicate that the redox poise of the plastoquinone pool and the overall cellular energy needs are the basic driving forces behind these changes in the photosynthetic apparatus. Throughout the course of the diurnal cycle, Photosystem II becomes very heterogeneous as determined by 77 K fluorescence spectra, PAM fluorescence and O2-flash yield experiments. This system provides some important insight into cyanobacterial state transitions and, especially, on the organization of the photosystems within the membrane. Overall, PS II is altered on both the oxidizing and reducing sides of the photosystem.\"\n",

The genes for N2 fixation displayed a strong circadian behavior, whereas photosynthesis and respiration genes were not as tightly regulated. One of our main objectives was to determine the strategies used by these cells to perform N2 fixation under normal day-night conditions, as well as under the greater stress caused by continuous light. We determined that N2 fixation cycled in continuous light but with a lower N2 fixation activity. Glycogen degradation, respiration, and photosynthesis were also lower; nonetheless, O2 evolution was about 50% of the normal peak. We also demonstrated that nifH (encoding the nitrogenase Fe protein), nifB, and nifX were strongly induced in continuous light; this is consistent with the role of these proteins during the assembly of the enzyme complex and suggested that the decreased N2 fixation activity was due to protein-level regulation or inhibition. Many soluble electron carriers (e.g., ferredoxins), as well as redox carriers (e.g., thioredoxin and glutathione), were strongly induced during N2 fixation in continuous light. We suggest that these carriers are required to enhance cyclic electron transport and phosphorylation for energy production and to maintain appropriate redox levels in the presence of elevated O2, respectively.\"\n",

Genes that are upregulated at a particular time of day under diurnal cycle also get upregulated at an equivalent metabolic phase under LL suggesting tight coupling of various cellular events with each other and with the cell’s metabolic status. A number of metabolic processes get upregulated in a coordinated fashion during the respiratory phase under LL including glycogen degradation, glycolysis, oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, and tricarboxylic acid cycle. These precede nitrogen fixation apparently to ensure sufficient energy and anoxic environment needed for the nitrogenase enzyme. Photosynthetic phase sees upregulation of photosystem II, carbonate transport, carbon concentrating mechanism, RuBisCO, glycogen synthesis and light harvesting antenna pigment biosynthesis. In Synechococcus elongates PCC 7942, a non-nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria, expression of a relatively smaller fraction of genes oscillates under LL condition with the major periodicity being 24 h. In contrast, the entire cellular machinery of Cyanothece orchestrates coordinated oscillation in anticipation of the ensuing metabolic phase in both LD and LL.

    "\"In a recent report, metabolism of Cyanothece 51142 has been shown to oscillate between photosynthetic and respiratory phases under LL with free running periods that are temperature dependent but significantly shorter than the circadian period. Further, the oscillations shift to circadian pattern at moderate cell densities that are concomitant with slower growth rates. Here we take this understanding forward and demonstrate that the ultradian rhythm under LL sustains at much higher cell densities when grown under turbulent regimes that simulate flashing light effect. Our results suggest that the ultradian rhythm in metabolism may be needed to support higher carbon and nitrogen requirements of rapidly growing cells under LL. With a comprehensive Real time PCR based gene expression analysis we account for key regulatory interactions and demonstrate the interplay between clock genes and the genes of key metabolic pathways. Further, we observe that several genes that peak at dusk in Synechococcus peak at dawn in Cyanothece and vice versa. The circadian rhythm of this organism appears to be more robust with peaking of genes in anticipation of the ensuing photosynthetic and respiratory metabolic phases.\"\n",

DUAL-PAM fluorometric meth-ods were used to observe physiological responses in Cyanothece sp. photosystems I and II. Results show that photosystem I activity was maintained under all environmental conditions tested, while photosystem II activity was not observed at all. Out of the environmental factors tested (temperature, salinity, and nitrogen presence), only temperature significantly influ-enced photosystem I activity. In particular, high temperature (40 °C) facilitated faster electron transport rates, while effects of salinity and nitrogen were variable. Cyanothece sp. has shown to sustain bloom status for long periods largely because of the essential role of photosystem I activity during highly dynamic and even extreme (e.g., salinities higher than 200) environmental conditions. This ensures the continual supply of cellular energy (e.g. ATP) to important processes such as nitrogen assimilation, which is essential for protein synthesis, cell growth and, therefore, bloom maintenance.\""

It was found thatCyanothece51142 continues to oscillate between photosynthesisand respiration in continuous light under mixotrophy with cycle time of\u001813 h. Mixotrophy is markedby an extended respiratory phase compared with photoautotrophy. It can be argued that glycerol pro-vides supplementary energy for nitrogen fixation, which is derived primarily from the glycogen reservesduring photoautotrophy. The genes of NDH complex, cytochrome c oxidase and ATP synthase are sig-nificantly overexpressed in mixotrophy during the day compared to autotrophy with synchronousexpression of the bidirectional hydrogenase genes possibly to maintain redox balance. However, nitroge-nase complex remains exclusive to nighttime metabolism concomitantly with uptake hydrogenase.

    "\"We report identification of a temperature-dependent ultradian metabolic rhythm that controls the alternating oxygenic and microoxic processes of Cyanothece sp. ATCC 51142 under continuous high irradiance and in high CO2 concentration. During the oxygenic photosynthesis phase, nitrate deficiency limited protein synthesis and CO2 assimilation was directed toward glycogen synthesis. The carbohydrate accumulation reduced overexcitation of the photosynthetic reactions until a respiration burst initiated a transition to microoxic N2 fixation. In contrast to the circadian clock, this ultradian period is strongly temperature-dependent: 17 h at 27 °C, which continuously decreased to 10 h at 39 °C. The cycle was expressed by an oscillatory modulation of net O2 evolution, CO2 uptake, pH, fluorescence emission, glycogen content, cell division, and culture optical density. The corresponding ultradian modulation was also observed in the transcription of nitrogenase-related nifB and nifH genes and in nitrogenase activities. We propose that the control by the newly identified metabolic cycle adds another rhythmic component to the circadian clock that reflects the true metabolic state depending on the actual temperature, irradiance, and CO2 availability.\""

Such interesting metabolism and regulation has led to the sequencing of its genome. The genome includes a large cluster that contains all of the genes required for nitrogenase assembly and function. We have developed a genetic transformation system for Cyanothece by using electroporation and CaCl2 treatment.

Nitrogenase expression was limited to N(2)-fixing conditions, and in the absence of glycerol, nitrogenase gene expression was linked to the dark period. However, glycerol induced expression of nitrogenase during part of the light period, together with cytochrome c oxidase (Cox), glycogen phosphorylase (Glp), and glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) enzymes. This indicated that nitrogenase expression in the light was facilitated via higher levels of respiration and glycogen breakdown. Key enzymes of the Calvin cycle were inhibited in Cyanothece ATCC 51142 in the presence of glycerol under H(2)-producing conditions, suggesting a competition between these sources of carbon. However, in Cyanothece PCC 7822, the Calvin cycle still played a role in cofactor recycling during H(2) production. Our data comprise the first comprehensive profiling of proteome changes in Cyanothece PCC 7822 and allow an in-depth comparative analysis of major physiological and biochemical processes that influence H(2) production in both strains. Our results revealed many previously uncharacterized proteins that may play a role in nitrogenase activity and in other metabolic pathways and may provide suitable targets for genetic manipulation that would lead to improvement of large-scale H(2) production.\""
